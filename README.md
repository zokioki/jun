# Jun

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jun.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jun)

Jun is a simple, [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)-inspired web application framework. This is a rough implementation, built with the goal of learning more about Rails internals. Not meant for production use.

## Getting Started

Install the gem:

```
$ gem install jun
```

Then, create a new Jun application:

```
$ jun new my_app
```

Change directory into `my_app` and start up the server:

```
$ cd my_app
$ bin/jun server
```

Visit `http://localhost:6291` to view your app.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## License
